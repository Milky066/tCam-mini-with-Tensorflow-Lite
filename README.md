# tCam-mini-with-Tensorflow-Lite
Incorporate machine learning capability into tCam-mini

***Special thank to Dan Julio for clarification on all of my inquiries regarding the project and his hardware***

This project is based on the tCam thermal imaging sensor made by Dan Julio.
[Here is the original repository](https://github.com/danjulio/tCam)

Specifically here is where the firmware is adapted from.

Please check out Dan Julio [website](http://www.danjuliodesigns.com/products/tcam_mini.html) for more details 

The aim of this project is to use tCam-mini to capture and detect the current frame, and determine 
the classification of the frame. This prototype is meant to be used in a static environment where the camera
itself does not move.

| Classification | 
| -------------- | 
|   Wet floor    | 
|   Dry floor    | 
| Human in frame |
|  Mopped floor  |
