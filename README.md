## tCam-Mini Firmware
tCam-Mini firmware is an Espressif IDF project.  You need to have the Espressif v4.4.2 IDF installed to build the firmware.  Pre-compiled binary files are provided (```precompiled``` directory here) and can be programmed using the IDF tools or a Windows utility as described in the ```programming``` directory elsewhere in this repostitory.

### Building
The ```sdkconfig``` file contains ESP32 configuration and build-specific information.  All camera-specific configuration is in the ```main/system_config.h``` file.

To build the project: ```idf.py build```

To load the project onto tCam-Mini: 

1. Plug tCam-Mini into your computer
2. ```idf.py -p PORT -b 921600 flash``` where PORT is the name of the serial port associated with gCore.

To monitor diagnostic information from the firmware: ```idf.py -p PORT```.  Output is at 115200 baud.  Note the command will reboot the camera.

### Revision History

#### FW 3.1 (9/1/2022)
FW revision 3.1 fixes issues and enhances Lepton support.

 1. Moved to Espressif IDF 4.4.2 (now using esp_netif, adjusted task priorities, stack size).
 2. Support 63 character WiFi passwords.
 3. Fixed bug with Lepton detection.
 4. Fixed bug where WiFi restart fails when setting client mode with static IP.

#### FW 3.0 (8/6/2022)
FW revision 3.0 is a major new release.  It is designed to run on tCam-Mini and tCam-POE PCBs with Revision 3 silicon and 8 MB Flash memory).

1. Support tCam-POE board
2. Optimize flash reads for improved performance
3. Added mDNS for camera discovery
4. Changed model usage to support tCam-POE (model 2 is for tCam-Mini board, model 3 is for tCam-POE board)
5. Added Interface Type flags to model number
6. Add timeout to SPI slave read
7. Blink error LED if SPI Slave fails
8. Fix bug where unknown json command would crash camera

#### FW 2.1 (2/5/2022)
FW revision 2.1 fixes the following issues.  It is designed to run on the tCam-Mini PCBs with Revision 3 silicon and 8 MB Flash memory (camera's built using Revision 1 silicon or less than 8 MB Flash memory should use FW revision 1.3).  It fixes an issue where setting a password of less than 8 characters would brick the tCam-Mini (requiring reload of firmware using the Windows utility).

1. Prevent updating Wifi password if the length is less than 8 characters to avoid a condition where the ESP32 wifi library fails on boot and the camera can't be reconfigured.
2. Add the ability to reset WiFi even when the camera has detected a hardware fault on boot (backup solution to #1 above).

#### FW 2.0 (11/23/2021)
FW revision 2.0 adds the following new features.  It is designed to run on the tCam-Mini PCBs with Revision 3 silicon and 8 MB Flash memory (camera's built using Revision 1 silicon or less than 8 MB Flash memory should use FW revision 1.3).

1. Faster performance - often reaching the full 8.7 fps over WiFi.
2. Support for Lepton 3.0.
3. Support for OTA FW updates (from the Desktop Application 2.0). It wonâ€™t be necessary to use the serial IF and Espressif utility to load new firmware releases after 2.0 is loaded.
4. Support for a new HW Slave interface (available on PCB revision 4) for direct connect to another Micro (I use this for tCam).

### Command Interface
The camera is capable of executing a set of commands and generating responses or sending image data when connected to a remote computer via one of the interfaces.  It can support one remote connection at a time.  Commands and responses are encoded as json-structured strings.  The command interface exists as a TCP/IP socket at port 5001 when using WiFi.

Each json command or response is delimited by two characters.  A Start delimiter (8-bit value 0x02) precedes the json string.  An End delimiter (8-bit value 0x03) follows the json string.  The json string may be tightly packed or may contain white space.

```<0x02><json string><0x03>```

The camera currently supports the following commands.  The communicating application should wait for a response from commands that generate one before issuing subsequent commands (although the camera command buffer is 12,288 bytes (sized for the ```fw_segment``` command) and can support multiple short commands).

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [get_status](#get_status) | Returns a packet with camera status.  The application uses this to verify communication with the camera. |
| [get_image](#get_image) | Returns a packet with metadata, radiometric (or AGC) image data and Lepton telemetry objects. |
| [set_time](#set_time) | Set the camera's clock. |
| [get_config](#get_config) | Returns a packet with the camera's current settings. |
| [get\_lep_cci](#get_lep_cci) | Reads and returns specified data from the Lepton's CCI interface. |
| [run_ffc](#run_ffc) | Initiates a Lepton Flat Field Correction. |
| [set_config](#set_config) | Set the camera's settings. |
| [set\_lep_cci](#set_lep_cci) | Writes specified data to the Lepton's CCI interface. |
| [set_spotmeter](#set_spotmeter) | Set the spotmeter location in the Lepton. |
| [stream_on](#stream_on) | Starts the camera streaming images and sets the interval between images and an optional number of images to stream. |
| [stream_off](#stream_off) | Stops the camera from streaming images. |
| [get_wifi](#get_wifi) | Returns a packet with the camera's current WiFi and Network configuration. |
| [set_wifi](#set_wifi) | Set the camera's WiFi and Network configuration.  The WiFi subsystem is immediately restarted.  The application should immediately close its socket after sending this command. |
| [fw\_update_request](#fw_update_request) | Informs the camera of a OTA FW update size and revision and starts it blinking the LED alternating between red and green to signal to the user a OTA FW update has been requested. |
| [fw_segment](#fw_segment) | Sends a sequential chunk of the new FW during an OTA FW update. |

The camera generates the following responses.

| Response | Description |
| --- | --- |

#### get_image
```{"cmd":"get_image"}```

#### get_image response
WiFi only.  Response to get_image or initiated periodically while streaming.

```
{
	"metadata":	{
		"Camera": "tCam-Mini-EFB5",
		"Model": 2,
		"Version": "1.0",
		"Time": "19:00:58.644",
		"Date": "2/3/21"
	},
	"radiometric": "I3Ypdg12B3YPdgt2BXYRdgF2A3YFdgF2AXYNdv91+3ULdvd..."
	"telemetry": "DgCDMSkAMAgAABBhCIKyzJpkj..."
}
```

| Image Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| metadata | Camera status information at the time the image was acquired. |
| radiometric | Base64 encoded Lepton pixel data (19,200 16-bit words / 38,400 bytes).  Each pixel contains a 16-bit absolute (Kelvin) temperature value when the Lepton is operating in Radiometric output mode.  The Lepton's gain mode specifies the resolution (0.01 K in High gain, 0.1 K in Low gain). Each pixel contains an 8-bit value when the Lepton has AGC enabled. |
| telemetry | Base64 encoded Lepton telemetry data (240 16-bit words / 480 bytes).  See below for some important telemetry words and the Lepton Datasheet for a full description of the telemetry contents. |

#### image_ready response
Hardware Interface only.  Response to get_image or initiated periodically while streaming.

```{"image_ready": 51980}```

The ```image_ready``` response indicates that an image is available to read from the slave SPI interface.  The value indicates the number of bytes in the image, including the start and end delimiters. It is followed by a 4 byte checksum and 0-3 dummy bytes.  The dummy bytes may be necessary since the SPI read length must be a multiple of 4 bytes.  The SPI read must be a single operation and the image must be read from the slave SPI interface before another image will be sent.  For FW 2.0 and 2.1, the camera's response process hangs until the image is read.  Subsequent firmware releases timeout and discard the image after one second.

![SPI Data layout](../pictures/hw_if_spi_data.png)

The checksum is simply the 32-bit sum of all ```image_ready``` response bytes with the high byte first.  It is used to validate that the SPI transfer successfully sent all bytes.  On occasion the ESP32 slave SPI driver may fail to keep up and the checksum is used to discard corrupt images.

#### stream_on
```
{
	"cmd":"stream_on",
	"args":{
		"delay_msec":0,

| num_frames | Number of frames to send before ending the stream session.  Set to 0 for no limit (set\_stream_off must be sent to end streaming). |

Streaming is a slightly special case for the command interface.  Responses are typically generated after receiving the associated get command.  However the image response is generated repeatedly by the camera after streaming has been enabled at the rate, and for the number of times, specified in the set\_stream\_on command.

#### stream_off
```{"cmd":"stream_off"}```

| ap\_ip_addr | The camera's IP address when it is in AP mode. |
| sta\_ip_addr | The static IP address to use when the camera is a client and configured to use a static IP. |
| sta_netmask | The netmask to use when the camera is a client and configured to use a static IP. |
| cur\_ip_addr | The camera's current IP address.  This may be a DHCP served address if the camera is configured in Client mode with static IP addresses disabled. |

Password information is not sent as part of the wifi response.

| Flag Bit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 7 | Client Mode - Set to 1 for Client Mode, 0 for AP mode. |

{
  "cmd": "set_wifi",
  "args": {
    "ap_ssid": "ANewApName",
    "ap_pw: "apassword",
    "ap_ip_addr": "192.168.4.1",
    "flags": 145,

    "sta_ip_addr": "10.0.1.144",
    "sta_netmask": "255.255.255.0"
  }
}
```

Individual args values may be left out (for example to just set AP or Client (STA) values.  The camera will use the existing value.

| set_wifi argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ap_ssid | Set the AP-mode SSID and also the camera name as reported in the metadata and status objects (1-32 characters). |
| ap_pw | Set the AP-mode password (8-63 characters). |
| ap\_ip_addr | The camera's IP address when it is in AP mode. |

The command will fail if an SSID is zero length or greater than 32 characters or if a password is less than 8 characters or greater than 63 characters.

Although I do not recommend it, use the following procedure to set a zero-length (null) password.

1. Reset the Wifi configuration using the Wifi reset button.  This sets all password fields to a null value.
2. Use the Desktop application to configure the Wifi but make sure the password field is not updated (de-select the Update checkbox).  Alternatively send a set_wifi command without a password (```ap_pw``` or ```sta_pw``` argument). 

#### cam_info messages
The ```cam_info``` response is generated for commands that do not return a response such as ```set_clock```, ```set_config``` or ```set_wifi``` with status about the success or failure of the command.  It can also be generated by the camera for certain errors.

For example, ```cam_info``` for ```set_clock``` looks like.

```
{
  "cam_info": {
    "info_value": 1,
    "info_string": "set_clock success"
  }
}
```

| cam_info Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| info_value | A decimal status code (see below). |
| info_string | An information string. |

| cam_info status code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Command NACK - the command failed.  See the information string for more information. |

| 2 | Command unimplemented - the camera firmware does not implement the command. |
| 3 | Command bad - the command was incorrectly formatted or was not a json string. |
| 4 | Internal Error - the camera detected an internal error.  See the information string for more information. |
| 5 | Debug Message - The information string contains an internal debug message from the camera (not normally generated). |

#### fw\_update_request
The ```fw_update_request``` command initiates the FW update process.

```
{
  "cmd":"fw_update_request",
  "args":{"length":730976,"version":"2.0"}
}
```

All arguments are required.

| fw\_update_request argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| length | Length of binary file in bytes. |
| version | Binary file version.  This must match the build version embedded in the binary file. |

#### get_fw
The camera requests a chunk of the binary file using the ```get_fw``` response after the user has initiated the update.  Currently the camera will request a maximum of 8192 bytes.

```
{
  "get_fw":{
    "start":0,
    "length":8192
  }
}
```

| get_fw argument Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| start | Starting byte of the current chunk (offset into binary file). |
| length | Number of bytes to send in a subsequent ```fw_segment```. |

#### fw_segment
Generated in response to a ```get_fw``` request.  Must always use the arguments in the ```get_fw``` request.

```
{
  "cmd":"fw_segment",
  "args":{
    "start":0,
    "length":8192,
    "data":"6QYCMPwUCEDuAAAAAAADAAAAAAAAAAABIABAPwjEAQAyVM2rAAAAAAAAA..."
  }
}
```

| fw_segment Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| start | Starting byte of current chunk. |
| length | Length of chunk in bytes. |
| data | Base64 encoded binary data chunk. |
 
### OTA FW Update Process
The OTA FW update process consists of several steps.  The FW is contained in the binary file ```tCamMini.bin``` in the precompiled FW directory or built using the Espressif IDF.  No other binary files are required.

1. An external computer initiates the update process by sending a ```fw_update_request```.
2. The camera starts blinking the LED in an alternating red/green pattern to indicate a FW update has been requested.  The user must press the Wifi Reset Button to confirm the update should proceed.
3. The camera sends a ```get_fw``` to request a chunk of data from the computer.
4. The computer sends a ```fw_segment``` with the requested data.
5. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated until the entire firmware binary file has been transferred.
6. The camera validates the binary file and sends a ```cam\_info``` indicating if the update is successful or has failed.  If successful the camera then reboots into the new firmware.

### Important Telemetry Locations

| Offset | 16-bit Word Description |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | Status Low (see below) |
| 4 | Status High |
| 99 | Emissivity (scaled by 8192) |
| 208 | TLinear Enabled Flag - 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled |
| 209 | TLinear Resolution Flag - 0 = 0.1, 1 = 0.01 |
| 210 | Spot Meter Mean - 16-bit radiometric value |
| 214 | Spot Meter Y1 coordinate |
| 215 | Spot Meter X1 coordinate |
| 216 | Spot Meter Y2 coordinate |
| 217 | Spot Meter X2 coordinate |


| Bit | Status Bit Description |
| --- | --- |
| 20 | Over Temperature Shut Down imminent (shutdown in 10 seconds) |
| 15 | Shutter Lockout - 0 = not locked out, 1 = locked out (outside of valid operating temperature range -10Â°C to 80Â°C) |
| 12 | AGC State - 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled |
| 5:4 | FFC State - 0 = Not commanded, 1 = Imminent, 2 = Running, 3 = Complete |
| 3 | FFC Desired |

#### Using telemetry data

The Status AGC State bit indicates the form of the pixel data.  When AGC is enabled the lepton performs a histogram analysis of the data and the pixel data is 8-bits (low byte of each 16-bit word) designed to directly index a palette array for display.  When AGC is disabled the lepton outputs 16-bit radiometric data in each pixel.  This data represents the actual temperature of each pixel in degrees Kelvin scaled by either 10 (TLinear Resolution Flag = 0) or 100 (TLinear Resolution Flag = 1).  The TLinear Resolution Flag indicates the gain mode of the Lepton (0 = Low Gain, 1 = High Gain).

The radiometric pixel temperature in Â°C may be computed using the following formula where TLinear resolution is 0.1 if TLinear Resolution Flag is 0 and 0.01 if TLinear Resolution Flag is 1.

``` TempC = Pixel[15:0] * TLinear_resolution - 273.15```

The Spot Meter average temperature value is computed using the same formula, substituting the Spot Meter Mean for pixel data, and is valid independent of AGC enabled or disabled.  The Spot Meter is the average value of the pixels in the box defined by the Spot Meter (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) coordinates.

The FFC State may be used to identify when the lepton is preparing to perform a FFC (flat field correction) and is performing a FFC.  While performing a FFC the lepton closes the shutter in front of the sensor array.  Image data is not available while a FFC is being performed.
